## Tips:

- Start with a comfortable speed (250-300 WPM) and gradually increase
- The highlighted letter (ORP) helps your eye anchor on each word
- Take breaks every 20-30 minutes to avoid eye strain
- Experiment with different text sizes to find what works best for you

## Acknowledgments

This project is utilises the groundbreaking research of Professor Mary C. Potter (MIT, Professor Emerita) who introduced the RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) paradigm in cognitive science. Her pioneering work demonstrated that humans can understand the meaning of words and pictures in fractions of a second, and that sentences can be comprehended when presented as rapidly as 12 words per second.

Professor Potter's research on attention, perception, and very-short-term memory has helped us understand how our brains process information at remarkable speeds. Her work has shown that while we can understand meaning almost instantly, stabilizing that information in memory takes longer, which is a key insight that makes RSVP such an effective speed reading technique.
